Admission to the undergraduate education is governed by the PLM Admission Test (PLMAT) for undergraduate colleges. The College of Law Admission Test (CLAT) and the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) select those who will be admitted to the professional schools. The graduate schools administer their respective admission processes.",
