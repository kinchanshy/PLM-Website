          The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM), created by a National
          Charter (RA 4196, 1965), was envisioned to be Manila's premiere
          institution for higher learning. It provides superior standards of
          instructions, as well as opportunities for outstanding research in
          technology and other areas for the development of the intellect and to
          advance human knowledge.

          The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila has adopted the policy of
          preferential option for the poor and therefore has prioritized
          education for the underprivileged but talented students of Manila.
          Committed to the highest intellectual and ethical standards, PLM
          strives to produce competent graduates with integrity who will be
          responsible citizens who can contribute effectively to local, national
          and global initiatives for the progressive and sustainable development
          of humanity.
