As such, it is believed that the involvement, collaborative efforts, and constituent support of the faculty, administrative staff and personnel of this university in scientific investigation and problem-solving through research will assist administration not only in demands for decision-making regarding forced attention to priorities, but also in policy formulation and/or revision if necessary. Thus, the foundations upon which the university system will be improved can be strengthened at every level for each of its constituents.",

This is in consideration of the work which the Research Office will undertake, the caliber of the person to head the office as well as the difficulty of getting the person because the work involved is highly specialized.",

Through synergism, the information flow of knowledge will be brought in and brought out in a smooth and stable sumbiosis where the UCRCS serves as its pricess 'center'.
